Donald Trump has been defeated, losing re-election to a second term due to your strong campaign.<p><p>The votes did take a while to count, because of all the mail-in ballots and the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, people were waiting anxiously to find out who would be elected. The President is making claims of \"election fraud\" and accuses you and the Democrats of rigging it against him, but he can whine and complain all he wants right? You did win after all, that is how the system works.<p><p>For the time being though, get ready to move into the White House to end the pandemic and move our country into a more progressive era. You are the oldest elected president, so try your hardest to stay as healthy as you can, or else 2024 may not go so well. Best of luck to you!</p>",

It is likely that you won much of the Midwest back, as well as perhaps a few states in the Southeastern coast. <p><p>Many on the right-wing did not expect this, and are absolutely distraught about this. Some are even calling for the election to be overturned due to fraud allegations, but it is very hard to believe that these allegations are actually true.<p><p>But you know what is true? You need to get ready to move into the White House to become the 46th president of the United States, and move this country out of the pandemic, and into a more progressive era. You are quite old though, so time will tell if your advanced age could work against you throughout your presidency. However, if you can stay healthy and strong, you could get re-elected in 2024, but there are no guarantees of that happening. Good luck!</p>",

You should get packed up and ready to move to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and get ready to bring your progressive agenda to the country.
